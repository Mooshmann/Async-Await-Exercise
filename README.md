The Numbers page will take the Numbers API and generate 4 facts behind my favorite number "13". Unfortunately, GitHub Pages needs HTTPS API functionality but Numbers API only works in HTTP. The fix to this is to pull the code and run it on your own machine.

The Random Cards page will give you a random card every time you press the button. This uses the DeckOfCards API.

I added the Pokemon Party Generator page to generate a random party of 6 Pokemon when you press the button. This fun application will give you a nice challenge if you want to play Pokemon with a random party! This uses the Poke API.
